# LiferayIAM

LiferayIAM is a set of modules for authentication using INDIGO-DATACLOUD IAM service.

These modules implement the authentication using OpenID Connect protocol
and they are able to manage the additional information provided by IAM such as
the user groups and others. Additionally, the modules made available the access
token for application running in the portal, or external to the portal, using the
remote APIs.

The code of the modules is based on some of the modules provided with Liferay 7.0
for the authentication with facebook and google and their configuration and management
is very similar.
