# LiferayIAM

Liferay modules for authentication using INDIGO-DATACLOUD IAM service.

These modules implement the authentication using OpenID Connect protocol
and are able to manage the additional information provided by IAM such as
the user groups and other. Additionally, the modules made available the access
token for application running in the portal, or external to the portal, using the
remote APIs.

The code of the modules is based on some of the modules provided with Liferay 7.0
for the authentication with facebook and google in order to make the integration
with Liferay as smooth as possible.
