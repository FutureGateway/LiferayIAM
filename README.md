# LiferayIAM
Modules for Liferay authentication with INDIGO-DATACLOUD IAM


The modules implement the authentication with the IAM service developed
in INDIGO-DATACLOUD EU project. The service is based on OpenID Connect
protocol.


The code of the modules is heavely based on the two modules provided with Liferay 7.0
for the authentication with facebook and google. This will require several changes to
take in account the user autherisation and token management.
